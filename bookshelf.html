    <p>I love reading, and sometimes I get asked for books I recommend. Here is a list of a few books I have read and really liked, with short notes on why they matter to me:</p>

    <ul class="books">
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Capital+in+the+Twenty-First+Century" target="_blank">Capital in the Twenty-First Century</a>: Thomas Piketty — Helped me understand how wealth and income inequality evolve over time, why capital tends to concentrate, and how this shapes modern democracies.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Principles+Ray+Dalio" target="_blank">Principles</a>: Ray Dalio — Taught me about radical transparency and the importance of explicitly writing down the core principles that guide your decisions and actions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=The+Hard+Thing+About+Hard+Things+Ben+Horowitz" target="_blank">The Hard Thing About Hard Things</a>: Ben Horowitz — Great for understanding how to navigate brutal, unsolvable problems when you’re the one in charge. Brutally honest about layoffs, pivots, crises, and the mental cost of being a founder. A must-read.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Venture+Deals+Brad+Feld+Jason+Mendelson" target="_blank">Venture Deals</a>: Brad Feld &amp; Jason Mendelson — A clear and practical guide to the world of venture capital. Crucial reading for any first-time founder who wants to negotiate with VCs from a position of understanding.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=The+Monk+Who+Sold+His+Ferrari+Robin+Sharma" target="_blank">The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari</a>: Robin Sharma — Inspired me to start meditating (didn’t stick, but still). Really liked its approach to slowing down, finding purpose, and reframing life’s priorities.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=The+Ballerina+of+Auschwitz+Edith+Eger" target="_blank">The Ballerina of Auschwitz</a>: Edith Eger — Great read. A reminder that no matter what happens, you can always choose how you respond, even in hard circumstances.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Zero+to+One+Peter+Thiel" target="_blank">Zero to One</a>: Peter Thiel - First book I read on how to build a company. challenged me to ask: what do I know to be true that almost everyone else disagrees with?.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Leading+Alex+Ferguson+Michael+Moritz" target="_blank">Leading</a>: Alex Ferguson &amp; Michael Moritz — Stuck with me: his obsession with discipline, culture, and long-term thinking. A well, as how to lead by example.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Steve+Jobs+Walter+Isaacson" target="_blank">Steve Jobs</a>: Walter Isaacson — With this book I understood the power of relentless vision, obsession with detail, even if people call you delusional.
      </li>
    </ul>
