    <p>A few books I recommend, with short notes on why they matter to me:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_in_the_Twenty-First_Century" target="_blank">
      Capital in the Twenty-First Century — Thomas Piketty
    </a>: Great for understanding how wealth and income inequality evolve over time, why capital tends to concentrate, and how this shapes modern democracies.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.principles.com/" target="_blank">
      Principles — Ray Dalio
    </a>: Taught me about radical transparency and the importance of explicitly writing down the core principles that guide your decisions and actions.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hard-Thing-About-Things-Building/dp/0062273205" target="_blank">
      The Hard Thing About Hard Things — Ben Horowitz
    </a>: Great for understanding how to navigate brutal, unsolvable problems when you’re the one in charge. Brutally honest about layoffs, pivots, crises, and the mental cost of being a founder. A must-read.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Venture-Deals-Smarter-Lawyer-Capitalist/dp/1119594820" target="_blank">
      Venture Deals — Brad Feld & Jason Mendelson
    </a>: A clear and practical guide to the world of venture capital. Crucial reading for any first-time founder who wants to negotiate from a position of understanding.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.robinsharma.com/book/the-monk-who-sold-his-ferrari" target="_blank">
      The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari — Robin Sharma
    </a>: Inspired me to start meditating (didn’t stick, but still). Loved its approach to slowing down, finding purpose, and reframing life’s priorities.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36623095-the-ballerina-of-auschwitz" target="_blank">
      The Ballerina of Auschwitz — Edith Eger
    </a>: A powerful reminder that no matter what happens, you can always choose how you respond, even in hard circumstances.
  </li>
    </ul>
